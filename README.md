## What I learned / Personal experience
This being my first project, it would be difficult to express all the knowledge gained here. At first, I was getting the very basics of setting up a development environment where I could copy and paste code to print "Hello World". From there I broke down each part of how it worked to understand it, created a loop, found a way to read keyboard input, devised a way to have a map and render it, move around, interact with objects, and eventually created something I was proud of. This project formed the foundation of my love for programming and coding.

In truth, the most important lessons here were not very code-specific. Learning how to approach new problems and finding solutions is a skill much more useful than knowing how to do any one specific thing. As this project progressed I quickly learned the importance of organization and comments/communication. This is likely a skill I will never truly master and always will be finding new ways to make my future self's(or other's) life easier. I had yet to learn how to create a multi-file project which was eventually a very obvious change I could have made. This was probably the largest reason why I stopped working on this project, along with believing it had served its purpose.

I had created something to experience from not much but my imagination. Creating something, even as small as this, that I could share with my friends left me wanting more so I set my sights on learning how to link files together and use a 2D graphics library.
